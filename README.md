# LeBlender

LeBlender is an open source Umbraco backoffice extension which made the Grid Canvas Editors management easier and flexible.
We can create, order, update, remove and extend Grid editors on the fly, through a very simple and nice user interface.
LeBlender project brings two main features:

## 1. LeBlender editor manager

This part of the project is a user interface tool for managing the grid editor settings.
Basically, it's a simple UI to edit the grid config file grid.editors.config.js. Through it, we can manage our Umbraco project's set of grid editors without manually writing any line of JSON code.
In addition, it possible to extend it with your own grid editor in a very easy way, see more information within the documentation.

## 2. LeBlender editor
LeBlender Editor is an additional editor that allow us to create complex data structures for our Grid in just a few clicks without any line of code.
Its main features are:
-100% configurable by UI
-Optional preview within the grid backend property editor
-Simple set of properties or list of them
-Any datatype can be used as LeBlenderEditor properties
-LeBlenderEditor can be cached
-Custom controllers can be used
